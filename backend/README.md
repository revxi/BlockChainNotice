# Backend Module

**Status:** Work in Progress / Placeholder

This module is currently under active development. The primary logic for the application is currently handled by the Frontend (client-side) directly interacting with the Blockchain (Smart Contract).

Future plans for this backend include:
- Off-chain indexing of notices for faster search.
- Caching IPFS content.
- User authentication service.
